# notes-app

A notes app built with Javascript using a model, view, client structure. This project was made by completing a series of exercises during the [JavaScript Web Applications module](https://github.com/atcq9876/javascript-web-applications) of the Makers Bootcamp (week seven). The objectives I achieved during this module include:
- Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
- Use the DOM API to manipulate the web page structure and content.
- Use fetch to send HTTP requests to a remote server.
